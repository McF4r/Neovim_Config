Still developing, so there are many commented out lines for future adjustment

- VSCode-like Auto-completion setup
- Mason for native neovim LSP management
- treesitter for highlighting
- Plugins: bufferline, lualine, nvim-tree, navic, noice, vimspector, todotree ...
- colortheme: catppuccin
- specially setup for Rust development
- **[Neovide](https://neovide.dev/) HIGHLY recommend**
- The `<leader>` key has been changed to `<space>`
